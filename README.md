## Introduction
----

Customer segmentation is an effective tool for businesses to closely align their strategy and tactics with, and better target, their customers. Every customer is different and every customer journey is different so a single approach often isnâ€™t going to work for all. This is where customer segmentation becomes a valuable process.

## Problem Statement

E-commerce is a highly competitive industry with an increasingly demanding customer base. It's not enough to simply set up an online store and assume that orders will come flooding in. You need to be constantly testing, learning and optimizing. <br>

Growth is expected to continue in the e-commerce industry, which opens up many opportunities. In order to position for success in this growing space, I am engaged by a UK online retail company to analyse customer behaviour and make recommendations to optimize marketing and retention strategies.

## Data Set
